# pt-menu

Python Menu to start programms from a Phyton with Tkinter installed screen/windows

Very simple menu screen to start/execute programms. Easy to add news or modyfy.

Mainly I added examles for Windows, but it can used for all system they run Python and Tkinter.

Requirements: Phython3.x, TKinter
